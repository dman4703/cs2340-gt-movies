## Team-based Project  
### First Project – GT Movies Store  

### Objective  
The goal of this project is to design and develop a web application using Django that enables users to access information about movies and place orders to purchase them. This project follows the process featured in the textbook *“Django 5 for the Impatient: Learn the core concepts of Django to develop Python web applications”* by Dr. Daniel Correa and Mr. Greg Lim—see reference.

## Description  
GT Movies Store is a web application that allows users to access information about movies and place orders to purchase them. Users will also be able to list, create, edit, and delete movie reviews. The application will feature a user-friendly interface and provide useful information about each movie, such as its name, price, description, and an image.  

This project will help reinforce the different concepts covered in class and build your skills in software engineering. For this purpose, you will work in a team of peers to design and build a software product following an agile methodology. This activity is designed to be a fun project that you can use to boost your portfolio!

## Grading  

The project will be graded based on two core factors: **product** and **process**.  

### Product  
Your team will need to satisfy the client (a member from the instructional team: i.e., your mentor TA) based on the user stories you complete. User stories will be graded as whole-or-nothing: partial functionality will not earn points.  

### Process  
Your team must follow Scrum and its different elements. Communication, cooperation, planning, feedback, and balance are essential. Issues that will sanction your team are:  

- Lack of effective communication with the client.  
- Lack of effective communication among teammates.  
- Lack of planning and follow-ups (daily standups).  
- Unbalanced distribution of work.  
- Lack of cooperation and conflict resolution.  

---

### Grade Breakdown  

- **Outstanding (100%)**: Both product and process were successful!  
  - Product: Your app successfully works, features all required user stories, and presents a nice GUI.  
  - Process: The process was successful and incorporated effective communication, cooperation, planning, feedback, and balance. No issues were reported.  

- **Okay (70%)**: At least one of the following is true:  
  - Product: Your app features fewer user stories than those required.  
  - Product: Your app has flaws in its GUI design.  
  - Process: Issues related to communication, planning, teamwork, or work balance.  

- **Less than Okay (50%)**: Two to four of the issues listed under "Okay" are true.  

- **Rejected (0%)**: Five or more of the issues listed under "Okay" are true.  

#### Disclaimers  
1. Teams must record teammates’ contributions and effectively communicate with their mentor TA. Not communicating issues early may result in a grade below “Outstanding.”  
2. Your mentor TA and the instructional team will track individual progress and performance. Members not contributing to their teams and projects will receive a grade of zero (0) on the project. However, individuals may recover and lift penalties by demonstrating significant improvement before the project ends.

## Submission Requirements  

This project also involves creating a **team website** (not your Django web application) that showcases your submission: i.e., an online report.  

### Objectives  
The team website should include:  

- **Team Presentation**: Introduce your team, detailing each member's name, role, and contributions.  
- **GT Movies Store Description**: Describe the web app your team designed and developed, and explain how the screens and features respond to the selected user needs.  
- **Process Description**: Explain how your team followed Scrum and the design decisions behind your solution, including principles, patterns, and diagrams.  
- **Video Demonstration**: Include a demo video showcasing your web app and its features.  

**Note:** This team website is intended to help build your portfolios!
