Team-based Project

First Project – GT Movies Store

Objective

The goal of this project is to design and develop a web application using Django that enables users to access information about movies and place orders to purchase them. This project follows the process featured in the textbook “Django 5 for the Impatient: Learn the core concepts of Django to develop Python web applications” by Dr. Daniel Correa and Mr. Greg Lim—see reference.

Description

GT Movies Store is a web application that allows users to access information about movies and place orders to purchase them. Users will also be able to list, create, edit, and delete movie reviews. The application will feature a user-friendly interface and provide useful information about each movie, such as its name, price, description, and an image.

This project will help you reinforce the different concepts to be covered in class and build your skills in software engineering. For this purpose, you will be asked to work in a team of peers to design and build a software product following an agile methodology. We propose this activity to be a fun project that you can use to boost your portfolio!

Grading

The project will be graded based on two core factors: product and process.

Product: Your team will need to satisfy their client (a member from the instructional team: i.e., your mentor TA) based on the user stories you all will have to complete. User stories will be graded as whole-or-nothing: partial functionality will not earn you points.

Process: Your team will need to follow Scrum and its different elements. Communication, cooperation, planning, feedback, and balance are essential. Issues that will sanction your team are:

Lack of effective communication with the client.

Lack of effective communication among teammates.

Lack of planning and follow-ups (daily standups).

Unbalanced distribution of work.

Lack of cooperation and conflict resolution.

At the end of the project, based on these criteria, your grade will be calculated as follows:

Outstanding (100%): Both product and process were successful!

Product: Your app successfully works, features all user stories required, and presents a nice GUI.

AND

Process: The process was successful and incorporated effective communication, cooperation, planning, feedback, and balance. No issues were reported.

Okay (70%): When at least one of the following is true:

Product: Your app features fewer user stories than those required.

Product: Your app has flaws in its GUI design.

Process: Issues related to communication, planning, teamwork, or work balance.

Less than Okay (50%): When two to four of the issues listed under "Okay" are true.

Rejected (0%): When five or more of the issues listed under "Okay" are true.

Disclaimer #1: Teams are required to record teammates’ contributions and to effectively communicate with their mentor TA. Not communicating issues early may lead the team to be graded below “Outstanding.”

Disclaimer #2: This is a very simple rubric. The cornerstone is that you and your team communicate with your mentor TA. Be proactive when reaching out and showing your progress on the project!

Disclaimer #3: Your mentor TA and the instructional team will track each individual’s progress and performance during the project. Strikes may be delivered if a member’s work is subpar, leading to a reduced individual grade. Members not contributing to their teams and projects will get a grade of zero (0) on the first project. Nonetheless, individuals previously struck may be able to recover and lift existing penalties if their work and progress improve notoriously before the first project ends.

Submission Requirements

This project also involves creating a team website (not your Django web application) that showcases your submission: i.e., an online report. This is a chance for your team to highlight your hard work, creativity, and technical achievements!

Objectives: The team website should include:

Team Presentation: Introduce your team, detailing each member's name, role, and contributions.

GT Movies Store Description: Elaborate on the web app your team designed and developed, and describe how the different screens and features respond to the proposed user needs you selected.

Process Description: Explain how your team followed Scrum and the design decisions behind your solution: principles, patterns, etc. Use diagrams as tools to communicate your rationale.

Video Demonstration: Include a demo video showcasing your web app and its features.

Disclaimer: This team website is intended to help you all build your portfolios!
